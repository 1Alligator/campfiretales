# <ins>Campfire Tales</ins>

Campfire Tales is a mod for Minecraft that attempts to add a basic *player leveling* system to campfires in a similar fashion to the systems seen in **Dark Souls** and **The legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild**

___
## *- How it works -*
Simply **right-click** on a campfire to open up a menu which provides several different stat/item "trades" that cost XP levels.

## *- Customization -*
Campfire Tales is made to be customizable. By editing the config file you can change the block used, the trades offered, and more.

For the modpack makers out there I recommend pairing this mod with [Healing Campfire](https://github.com/Serilum/Healing-Campfire) *By Serilum* to really make campfires feel like a safe zone.
