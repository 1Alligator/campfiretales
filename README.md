Campfire Tales is a mod for Minecraft 1.21.10 which attempts to add a basic **player leveling** system to campfires.

___
## *- How it works -*
Simply **right-click** on a campfire to open up a menu which provides several different "trades" that cost XP levels. These trades can offer attribute and item rewards.

## *- Customization -*
Campfire Tales is made to be customizable. By editing the config file you can change the block used, the trades offered, and more.

For the modpack makers out there I recommend pairing this mod with [Healing Campfire](https://github.com/Serilum/Healing-Campfire) *By Serilum* to really make campfires feel like a safe zone.
