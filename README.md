# <ins>Campfire Tales</ins>

Campfire Tales is a mod for Minecraft that attempts to add a basic *player upgrade* system to campfires (or any block you desire) in a similar fashion to the systems seen in **Dark Souls** and **The legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild**

___
## *- How it works -*
Simply **right-click** on a campfire to open up a menu which provides several different stat/item "trades" that cost XP levels.

## *- Customization -*
Campfire Tales is made to be customizable. By editing the config file you can change the block used, the trades offered, and more. Since it operates via commands you can theoretically make pretty complex systems and ditch the "upgrade" side of things entirely.

This mod requires [owo-lib](https://github.com/wisp-forest/owo-lib) to function properly. Additionally, for the modpack makers out there I recommend pairing this mod with [Healing Campfire](https://github.com/Serilum/Healing-Campfire) *By Serilum* to really make campfires feel like a safety/upgrade zone.
